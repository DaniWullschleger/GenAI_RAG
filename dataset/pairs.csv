In this connection, a distinction is made between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is based on statistical models for predicting or estimating a result by means of one or more input variables. This method lends itself to solving problems in areas such as economics, medicine, astrophysics and politics. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, does not produce any examples of ""correct"" or ""expected"" outcomes, although relationships and connections can be identified from such data. The module focuses on methods of supervised learning and illustrates them with applied examples taken from real-life situations for the purpose of making predictions. Finally, important methods of unsupervised learning are discussed. In this module, students learn to apply supervised learning in practice and to understand its basic principles of unsupervised learning. Module type Required";What is the main focus of the module Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling 1?;The main focus of the module Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling 1 is on methods of supervised learning, illustrated with applied examples taken from real-life situations for the purpose of making predictions.;The question can be clearly answered based on the provided context, as it directly asks about the main focus of the module Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling 1.;5;This question is extremely useful to students at HSLU who are interested in understanding the core content and focus of the Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling 1 module.;5;The question is clear and specific, requiring no additional context to understand what is being asked.;5;5
effects on stakeholders. Students learn how to manage data projects successfully by understanding the role of collaboration, intelligent project task management, stakeholder management, and stakeholder expectations. This includes learning from mistakes when discovering new business requirements and deciding on how to best integrate or ignore what has been learned. Once organizations have acquired the necessary technical skills, they must be able to manage their projects effectively and efficiently in order to succeed. Furthermore, data projects are never managed in isolation, and project managers must therefore know the business context when working with data and be able to anticipate the implications for their company's policies. The module focuses also on the role of communication and the planning process in data science projects as derived from the practical challenges that arise once a project has been launched (e.g. in the late process steps after the pitch). In these later project phases, project managers must come to terms with an existing approach and a defined project setting.

It is a core component of the business intelligence process, serving as a central repository to unite data from diverse sources to create analytical reports for workers within the company. The data stored in a data warehouse originates from operational systems such as production, marketing, or sales and may pass through a functional data store. Data cleansing may be required for additional operations to ensure data quality before being used in the DW for reporting. The DWH concept, established thirty years ago, is commonplace in today's industry and, therefore, an essential concept for data scientists, as they might have to analyze DWH data in their future careers. The inclusion of generative AI methodologies is also welcomed as a support mechanism, particularly for creating simulations or predicting trends based on historical data.

This represents a challenge for computational processing. The analysis of text data has triggered the development of specialized methods at the intersection of Linguistics, Computer Science, and Machine Learning. These are commonly referred to as Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP powers - among many other applications - information extraction from text, sentiment analysis, automatic text summarization, machine translation, speech recognition, text classification, and virtual assistants. This module introduces the main building blocks of a text understanding pipeline. It focuses on techniques applicable in a business context. In the first part of the course, we will learn how to access and analyze textual resources, discover interesting patterns, extract relevant information from text data. In the second, we will be focusing on deep learning in NLP and scratch the surface of recent advances in foundation models.

Page 24 / 216 Module Descriptions – Master of Science in Applied Information and Data Science, Version 16.02.2024 Contents This seminar applies Happimetrics to track emotions between humans, and humans and other species (plants, animals). It uses AI to analyze interaction among humans – from online social media to body sensing - and predicting their emotions through machine learning. Knowing what makes you happy will make you happier! Analyzing people’s communication patterns and making them self-aware by mirroring their behavior back to them in a privacy-respecting way will increase individual happiness and team performance. Happimetrics takes three steps to building happiness and better performance through groupflow, starting with how to create happiness by analyzing communication, how to measure happiness, and how to optimize communication for more happiness and better teamwork by mirroring back the measurements to the individual. 1. Understand the basic concepts of groupflow – when teams collaborate at their best through intrinsic motivation and positive stress 2. Understand how analyzing your own communication behavior through virtual mirroring increases business performance and individual satisfaction 3. Understand how to build “entangled” teams by measuring synchronicity among team members using AI, SNA (social network analysis), and time series analysis.
